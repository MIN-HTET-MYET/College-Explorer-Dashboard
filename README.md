# Fabricland College Insights Dashboard

## 📖 Story  
In the magical realm of **Fabricland**, young wizards and heroes are preparing to choose their future colleges.  
But there’s a problem — a long, confusing list of colleges with scattered information.  
The **High Council of Education** has turned to **data wizards** (that’s the participants!) to bring order to chaos.  

## 🎯 Mission  
Craft an **insightful** and **visually captivating Power BI report** that helps the next generation of Fabricland’s students make **wise, data-driven choices** about where to study, grow, and launch their magical careers.

## ✨ My Storytelling & Dashboard Creation Process  

I began by exploring the dataset and **imagining myself as a student** — thinking about what I’d want to see first.  
Naturally, I’d look for **top colleges and programs**, then check **tuition costs** to see what fits my budget.  
If it fits, I’d explore further; if not, I’d filter by other preferences.  
My dashboard is built entirely around this simple and logical flow.
